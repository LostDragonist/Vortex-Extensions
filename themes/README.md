## Installation

Copy the folders to your Vortex themes directory.  This is probably located at `%APPDATA\Vortex\Themes`.

If you have Python installed, you can run `install.py` to copy the files automatically.  **Warning:** This will automatically delete any pre-existing themes with the same name with no warning!
